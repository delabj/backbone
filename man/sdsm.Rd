\title{The stochastic degree sequence model (sdsm) for backbone probabilities}
\usage{
sdsm(B, method = "RefinedNormal", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{graph: An unweighted bipartite graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.
Any rows and columns of the associated bipartite matrix that contain only zeros are automatically removed before computations.}

\item{method}{string: Specifies the method of the Poisson Binomial distribution computation used by the "ppbinom" function in \link[PoissonBinomial]{PoissonBinomial-Distribution}.
"RefinedNormal" gives quick, very accurate approximations, while "DivideFFT" gives the quickest exact computations.}

\item{...}{optional arguments}
}
\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, summary). Here
    `positive` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or above the observed value in the projection,
    `negative` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or below the observed value in the projection, and
    `summary` is a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: class, model name, number of rows, number of columns, and running time.
}
\description{
`sdsm` computes the probability of edge weights being
    above or below the observed edge weights in a bipartite projection
    using the stochastic degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
The sdsm function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \code{B*t(B)}
   to the distribution of weights expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite network where
   both the row vertex degrees and column vertex degrees are approximately fixed. It uses the Bipartite Configuration Model \link{bicm} (Saracco et. al (2015, 2017)) to compute probabilities for the Poisson binomial distribution.

The "backbone" S3 class object returned is composed of two matrices, and a summary dataframe.
