\title{The significance filter for backbone probabilities}
\usage{
sigfilter(G)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{graph: An graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.
Any rows and columns of the associated bipartite matrix that contain only zeros are automatically removed before computations.}
}
\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, summary). Here
    `positive` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or above the observed value,
    `negative` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or below the observed value, and
    `summary` is a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: model name, number of rows, skew of row sums, number of columns, skew of column sums, and running time.
}
\description{
`sigfilter` computes the probability of signed edge weights being
    above or below the observed edge weights using
    XXX. Once computed,
    use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
